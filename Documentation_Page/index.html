            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, it is the standardised language used for creating documents designed to be displayed on web browsers.
                it allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes </p>
            <p>It is also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can not create dynamic functionality. It is now considered an official web standard. 
                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.</p>

            <header>Getting Started With HTML</header>
            <p> To get started with HTML you need a text editor such as SublimeTEXT, Notepad++ or VisualCode. For this we will be using Visual Code</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First download the latest version of VisualCode</li> 
                <li>Open VisualCode</li> 
                <li>Create a new text file and choose HTML as your desired language</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you want to view your codes on a web browser, go to the extension section (ctrl+shift+x) then download the "live server 
                extension by Ritwick Dey. Once installed click "go live" at the bottom right of your file, this will display your code on a browser </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Elements">
            <header>HTML Elements</header>
            <p>Using this picture we will breakdown this simple HTML line containing an element</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example it is h1 for heading), which is then 
                    wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.</li>
                <li>Content: This is the content inside the element, in the example above it is the the heading text.</li>
                <li>Closing tag: The closing tag is situated at the end. It is also wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets however it also includes a slash. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>HTML elements can be nested which means that one elements can contain other elements). Nesting allows you to apply multiple HTML tags to a single 
                piece of content</p>
        </section>
       
       
        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Attributes">
            <header>HTML Attributes</header>
            <p>Within elements you can have attributes, An HTML attribute is a piece of markup language used to adjust the behavior or display of an HTML element.
                 For example, attributes can be used to change the color, size, or functionality of HTML elements. Below is an example line with an attribute</p>
            <img src="https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/13e3d224c01fe17853373d2c322a74e7.png" alt="HTML attribute anatomy" class="image"/>
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute
                 is an identifying name used to target the element information.</p>
